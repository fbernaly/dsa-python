# Python DSA

This repository contains sample implementations of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python. It is designed to help you understand and practice key concepts in sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this repository:

- [Selection Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort-algorithm-2/): A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- [Bubble Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort-algorithm/): A basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- [Insertion Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort-algorithm/): A sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time.
- [Merge Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/): A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- [Quick Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort-algorithm/): A highly efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array around a pivot element, recursively sorting the left and right subarrays.

Each algorithm includes test cases to demonstrate its functionality and correctness.
